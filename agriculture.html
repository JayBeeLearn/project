    <h1>Agriculture</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
      As long as there are humans, the need to consume food will always be
      there; one of the ways to boost a nation economy is for her people to
      produce and process the food which they consume. To actualize this, the
      State government therefore takes it upon Itself to equip Akwa Ibomites
      with the skills neccesary for them to cultivate and produce thier own
      food. Not just preparing foods, but gives them a market in which they can
      sell thier products.

      The Major and only department in the Agricultural sector was
      <b> Crop Production</b>. Here, the participants would be trained on
      various methods of cultivating crops.
