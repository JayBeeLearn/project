      <h1>The Man That Forsaw</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        His Excellency, The Executive Governor of Akwa Ibom State is a great visionary that has the state-interest at heart. TO build an Akwa Ibom what is completely self-dependent has always been his dream from conception. To actualize this dream, the state Governor has set up some things in the state to attract potential investors to the state. Things like <br> <b>Security</b> - which is paramount to the development of any society; <br> <b>Infrastructure</b> like industries; etc. <br>
      
          Now all this factors won't really function, without the most important factor: <b>The Human Factor</b>. The Human Factor is really important because the state won't still grow if by the end of the day, the said industries are being operated by foreigners without Akwa Ibom indigenes being part of the industries. That will create a very big gap in the development of Akwa Abasi Ibom State. <br>
          To address this menace, the Governor in his wisdom, sees the need to equip young Akwa Ibomites with the skills and technical-know-how so that when the industries are at their peaks, Akwa Ibom men and women would be fully qualified to work in such industries thereby building a better Akwa Ibom for ALL.

      <h1>The Man That Execute</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        His Honourable, The Commissioner for Akwa Ibom State Ministry Of Trade and Investment is a great Executioner. He understands and believes in the dream of the Governor to make Akwa Ibom State a better place for all. Driven by the need to improve Akwa Ibom in his quota, The Honourable Commissioner came up with the <b>IBOM3000 Project.</b> <br>
        The Ibom3000 Project is a brain-child of the Akwa Ibom State Ministry Of Trade and Investment aimed at training young Akwa Ibomites and to equip them with neccessary skills to make them employable in the future. With the surging of new industries in the Akwa Ibom State, it will not be wise to have outsiders come in and take the employment opportunities of Akwa Ibomites because <i>they are not competent.</i>  <b>God forbid!</b> <br>
        To solve that, the Akwa Ibom State Government through the Honourable Commissioner came up with the Ibom3000 Project that will train Akwa Ibomites in the fields of ICT, Oil and Gas, Agriculture and SME. This is to make Akwa Ibomites <b>EMPLOYABLE</b> in the near future.

      <h1>The Man That Supervise</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The Permanent Secretary for Akwa Ibom State Ministry of Trade and Investment, in person of Mr. Oliver Udoukpo has always find time in his busy schedule to always come and Supervise the trainees in thier place of assignment (along with other important dignitries from the Ministry of Trade and Investment). With the active suppervision, the trainees now see the need to take thier training seriously. <br>
        Just like a father who sends his children to school keeps track of their progress, the Permanent Secretary (alongside others) have always checked on the fairing of the trainess.
