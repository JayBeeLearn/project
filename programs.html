        ICT was introduce into the Ibom3000 project because of the major shift
        going on in world about how businesses are being carried out on a daily
        basis with ease through the use of related technologies. This
        technologies require update and management, thereby being
        computer-oriented and having these market-demand skills puts someone in
        a better position of securing a job anywhere in the world. Because of
        these foresight, the state government through the Ministry of Trade and
        Commerce deemed it neccesary to train Akwa Ibomites in the fiel of ICT.

      <p class="paragraph">
        It is without doubt that Oil and Gas is one of the major resources in
        AKwa Ibom and Nigeria at large. It would therefore be a shame not to
        have Akwa Ibomites that can work in relevant industries to process their
        own resource. Thus, the need for the State government through Ministry
        of Trade and Commerce to train Akwa Ibomites to work in relevant
        industries.

        As long as there are humans, the need to consume food will always be
        there; one of the ways to boost a nation economy is for her people to
        produce and process the food which they consume. To actualize this, the
        State government therefore takes it upon Itself to equip Akwa Ibomites
        with the skills neccesary for them to cultivate and produce thier own
        food. Not just preparing foods, but gives them a market in which they
        can sell thier products.

        The backbone economy of every developed nation lies on Small and Medium
        Enterprises. The need to create entrepreneurs who will in turn become
        employers in the future will help alot in the area of reducing
        unemployment in the state. That is why the state government takes it
        upon Itself to train and build employers thereby reducing unemployment,
        What <b>A STRATEGIC PLAN!</b>
